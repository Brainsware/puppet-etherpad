## Overview

This module installs and configures etherpad(-lite).
It's inspired by existing etherpad modules on the Forge, but attempts to "*do it rightâ„¢*".


## Setup

### What etherpad affects

* This module depends on [puppet-nodejs](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppet/nodejs)
* It also depends on [puppetlabs-vcsrepo](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/vcsrepo), and hence git
* It will setup a service using the system's preferred init

### Setup Requirements

This module requires a database. With no database available, it will use the fallback dirtydb.
dirtydb is not intended for production use.

For a migration from DirtyDB, please consult [this blog
post](https://codeborne.com/2011/10/19/etherpad-lite-migrate-data-from-dirtydb.html)

### Beginning with etherpad

Before to installation, a target database should exist. Please consult the
documentation of
[puppetlabs-postgresql](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/postgresql), or
[puppetlabs-mysql](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/mysql) for how to
create those.

## Usage

The basic usage is:

```puppet
include ::etherpad
```

note that this will use the local DirtyDB and is not recommended beyond basic testing.
For production setups, use:

```puppet
class { ::etherpad:
  ensure => 'present',
  db_provider => 'mysql',
  db          => 'etherpad',
  user        => 'etherpad',
  password    => '37h3rp4d',
}
```

## Reference

Here, list the classes, types, providers, facts, etc contained in your module. This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess with things. (We are working on automating this section!)

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc.

## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them know what the ground rules for contributing are.
